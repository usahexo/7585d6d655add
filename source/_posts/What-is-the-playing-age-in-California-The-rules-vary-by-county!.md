#  What is the playing age in California? The rules vary by county!

While most states in the U.S. have a minimum playing age of 6 years old, California has a minimum age of 7. However, the rules vary by county.

Other counties, like Contra Costa County, allow children as young as 5 to participate in tackle football.

So what is the statewide minimum age for tackle football in California? 7 years old. Parents should consult their specific countyâ€™s regulations to determine the minimum playing age for their area.
