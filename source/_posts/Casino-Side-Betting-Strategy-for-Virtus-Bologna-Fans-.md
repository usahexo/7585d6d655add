#  Casino Side Betting Strategy for Virtus Bologna Fans 

A little known casino strategy that can be used to your advantage when betting on Virtus Bologna games is to place a side bet on them. The way this works is by betting on Virtus Bologna to win the game, and then also placing a side bet on them to win by more than the spread. So for example, if Virtus Bologna is playing against Naples and the spread is 3 points, you would place a side bet on them to win by 4 or more points.

The reason this strategy works well is because Virtus Bologna are usually a stronger team than their opponents, and they tend to beat them by more than the spread. This has been proven statistically,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/) as over the past few seasons Virtus Bologna have won by more than the spread more than 50% of the time. So if you are confident in their ability to win, using this strategy can give you a better chance of winning your bets.

Another great thing about this strategy is that even if Virtus Bologna don’t end up winning the game, you still have a good chance of winning your side bet. This is because there is usually a high chance of at least one team winning by more than the spread, so if you bet on the other team you are likely to still get some money back.

So if you are looking for a way to increase your chances of winning when betting on Virtus Bologna games, be sure to try out this side betting strategy. It has been proven to work well in the past, so give it a try today and see how much money you can make!

#  Playing Perfect Blackjack with the Spanish 21 Side Bet 

There’s no question that blackjack is one of the most popular casino games played today. But if you’re looking to up the excitement and potentially win more money, then you should try playing Spanish 21 instead.

With Spanish 21, not only do you get the traditional blackjack game, but you can also make a side bet that pays out based on how “perfect” your hand is. Here’s a look at how to play perfect blackjack with the Spanish 21 side bet, and some tips on how to give yourself the best chance of winning.

## The Basics of Spanish 21 

If you’ve never played Spanish 21 before, don’t worry – it’s a lot like traditional blackjack. The main difference is that in Spanish 21, all face cards are worth 1 point instead of 10, and there are other rule changes that make the game a bit more advantageous for players.

To play Spanish 21, first choose your bet amount and place it in the designated spot on the table. Then, two cards are dealt to each player and the dealer, face up. The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over (or busting). If your total is higher than the dealer’s total but less than or equal to 21, you win!

If you want to make the optional side bet in Spanish 21 known as “Perfect Blackjack”, simply place an extra chip or chips in front of you next to your original bet. This wager pays out based on how perfect your hand is, as we’ll explain below.

## The Rules of Perfect Blackjack 

As we mentioned above, in order to win the Perfect Blackjack side bet in Spanish 21, your hand must be as close as possible to 21 without going over. Here are all the specific rules for making this wager:

-Your hand must consist of exactly two cards (no more, no less).
-The value of both cards must be between 2 and 21 points inclusive (e.g. 2, 3, 4, 5,...21).-Your two cards must be different point values (e.g. 2 and 16 are not valid).-If both cards are worth 10 points (i.e. a pair), then your hand is still worth 20 points (notPerfect).-Aces are always worth 1 point.-Smaller numbers are better than larger numbers (e.g. 12 is better than 7).
-If your two card total equals 22 or higher, then your hand automatically loses regardless of what the dealer has.(For example: Ace+Queen=22) 

So as long as your two cards add up to 20 points or less, you have a chance of winning the Perfect Blackjack side bet – even if the dealer has a higher total!

## Strategizing for Perfect Blackjack  

Now that you know all about how to play perfect blackjack with the Spanish 21 side bet, it’s time for some tips on how to improve your chances of winning! Here are three key things to keep in mind: 

1) Keep track of what the dealer has – One important factor in deciding whether or not to make the side bet is knowing what kind of hand the dealer has showing. For example, if you see that the dealer has an Ace upcard then they could easily have a blackjack (21), so it might not be wise to risk betting on perfect blackjack. On the other hand, if the dealer has a low card showing (2 through 6), then they are more likely to bust when they draw another card so this would be a good opportunity to make the side bet. 

2) Know which hands are strong and weak – Another key factor when playing perfect black jack is understanding which hands are good and bad. As a general rule, always try to stand on totals of 17 or higher since these hands have a good chance of beating the dealer. And remember that any combination totaling 20 points or less is usually safe enough to hit (draw another card) in hopes of getting closer to 21.(For example: Ace+5=16) 

3) Practice makes perfect! – Like any skillful activity, mastering perfect black jack takes practice! So be sure to take advantage of free online demos or practice games at online casinos before sitting down at a real table stakes game

#  Increase Your Chances of Winning at Blackjack with a Side Bet

When you sit down to play blackjack, your goal is to beat the dealer. With a side bet, you can increase your chances of winning and walk away with more money in your pocket.

There are a few different types of side bets you can make, so it's important to understand the options available before you place your bet.

One popular side bet is the 21+3 bet. This bet pays out based on the player's first two cards and the dealer's up card. If the player has a two card total of 21 or higher, they win even money on their bet. If the player has a total of less than 21, their odds are based on whether or not the dealer busts.

Another option is the insurance bet. When you make this bet, you're betting that the dealer has blackjack. If they do, you win 2-1 on your insurance bet. If they don't have blackjack, you lose your insurance bet.

There are other side bets available as well, so be sure to do your research before placing any wagers. By adding a side bet to your game, you can give yourself a better chance of winning and walk away with more cash in your pocket.
