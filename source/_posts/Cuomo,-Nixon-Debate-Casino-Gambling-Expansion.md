#  Cuomo, Nixon Debate Casino Gambling Expansion

A fierce debate over casino gambling expansion is underway in New York as Governor Andrew Cuomo and challenger Cynthia Nixon face off.

Cuomo has come out in support of expanding legalized gambling, while Nixon has said she’s against it. The disagreement comes as the state Legislature is contemplating a proposal to allow three new casinos and add table games to four racetracks with video lottery terminals.

Casino gambling is a major source of revenue for states, with New York taking in $1.7 billion last year. But the industry also has its critics, who argue that it preys on the poor and leads to addiction and other social problems.

Cuomo has been a consistent backer of casino gambling, saying it provides jobs and generates revenue for the state. He contends that the proposed expansion would be tightly regulated and would not lead to an increase in problem gambling.

“I am confident that we can do this in a way that is good for the people of this state,” Cuomo told reporters recently. “It will create jobs, it will create investment, it will create tourism, and it’s something that we should do.”

Nixon has questioned whether casino gambling is truly good for the people of New York and says the industry exploits addiction. She also says the proposal lacks adequate protections against problem gambling.

“Gambling is a predatory industry that preys on low-income people and leads to more bankruptcies, job losses and crime,” Nixon said in a statement. “We should not expand it into new areas of our state.”

#  Andrew Cuomo, Cynthia Nixon Battle Over Sports Betting In New York

Governor Andrew Cuomo and challenger Cynthia Nixon are trading barbs over the legality of sports betting in New York. In advance of a planned debate Wednesday, Cuomo's campaign released an online ad accusing Nixon of wanting to "legalize sports gambling" which he says is a bad idea.

But Nixon's camp says that's not what she wants. Instead, they say she supports legalizing sports betting in order to bring in new revenue for the state.

Cuomo has been a staunch opponent of legalizing sports betting in New York, vetoing a bill that would have allowed it earlier this year. But he has softened his stance in recent months, saying he would be open to it if it was regulated and taxed.

The issue is likely to come up during Wednesday's debate.

#  New York Governor Candidates Clash On Sports Betting

The two leading candidates for New York Governor, Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon, clashed over the issue of sports betting this week.

Cuomo, who is seeking a third term as Governor, said that he supported legalizing sports betting in the state. Nixon, who is running as a progressive challenger to Cuomo, said that she opposed it.

Cuomo argued that legalizing sports betting would generate millions of dollars in revenue for the state government. He also claimed that it would create jobs and help to revive the upstate economy.

Nixon countered that legalizing sports betting would lead to increased problem gambling rates and addiction problems. She also argued that it would be unfair to poorer people who could not afford to gamble on sports.

The issue of sports betting is likely to be a key issue in the upcoming gubernatorial election in New York.

#  Race Tightens In New York Governor's Contest As Sports Betting Issue Emerges

With just over two weeks to go before New Yorkers head to the polls to pick their next governor, the race has tightened up, with the latest polls showing incumbent Andrew Cuomo and challenger Cynthia Nixon in a virtual dead heat.

One issue that has emerged in the race is sports betting. Both Cuomo and Nixon have stated their positions on the matter, with Cuomo in favor of it and Nixon opposed.

Cuomo says that he supports sports betting because it would generate new revenue for the state. He also notes that it would create jobs and stimulate the economy.

Nixon, on the other hand, says that she is opposed to it because she believes it would be harmful to society and lead to more problem gambling. She also argues that it would be a bad investment for the state since most of the revenue generated would go to offshore casinos and not New York businesses.

The latest poll shows that 46 percent of voters are in favor of sports betting while 44 percent are opposed. 10 percent are undecided.

The issue of sports betting could play a role in the outcome of the race, especially if there is a close margin of victory.

#  Candidates For New York Governor Differ On How To Handle Sports Betting

There is currently much debate in the state of New York over how to handle sports betting. The two leading candidates for governor, Cynthia Nixon and Andrew Cuomo, have different opinions on the matter.

Nixon believes that sports betting should be legalized and regulated in order to generate revenue for the state. She has stated that this could bring in up to $100 million in additional taxes each year.

Cuomo, on the other hand, is opposed to legalizing sports betting. He believes that it would be difficult to regulate and that it could lead to gambling addiction problems.

The issue of sports betting is a complicated one. There are pros and cons to both sides of the argument. On one hand, legalizing sports betting could help generate much-needed revenue for the state. On the other hand, there are concerns about its potential effects on society, including gambling addiction problems.

It will be interesting to see which candidate wins this debate and becomes New York’s next governor.
