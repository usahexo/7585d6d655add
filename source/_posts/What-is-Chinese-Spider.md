#  What is Chinese Spider spin roulette?

Chinese spider spin roulette, also called "two-up" game is a simple gambling game, popular in Australia and some other countries. The game is played with two coins, or two dice. A player bets on whether the outcome will be Heads (H) or Tails (T). 

After placing a bet, one of the players flips a coin or throws two dice to determine the outcome. If the result is H or T, the player wins even money on their bet; if the result is 2, 3 or 12 (called "spiders"), the player loses; and if the result is any other number, that becomes the point at which players must double their bets. Play then alternates between players until one either reaches 21 points or busts (goes over 21).
