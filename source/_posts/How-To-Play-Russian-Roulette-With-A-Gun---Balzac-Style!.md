### Russian Roulette Games with Guns - A Deadly Balzac Style Fun!

If you are looking for a deadly form of fun, look no further than Russian roulette games with guns. Named after the famous French novelist, Honoré de Balzac, this game is not for the faint of heart. It can be played with any gun, but it is typically played with a revolver that has one bullet in the chamber and six bullets in the cylinder. The game is simple. One player spins the cylinder and puts the gun to his or her head. The other players take turns pulling the trigger until the gun goes off. If the player who spun the cylinder pulls the trigger and the gun doesn’t go off, he or she can put it back to their head and spin again. If the gun goes off when someone else pulls the trigger, that player is out of the game. The last player left wins.

This deadly game became popular in France in the early 1800s. It is said that Balzac himself devised this game as a way to gamble and have some fun. While there is no evidence that he ever actually played it, there are reports that members of his social circle did play it.
