#  Origins of blackjack traced back to Algeria

Origins of blackjack can be traced back to a game played in Algeria in the 1700s. The game was called “vingt-et-un”, which is French for twenty-one. In this game, players tried to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over. The ace was worth 1 point, and the other cards were worth their face value. If the player exceeded 21 points, they lost the game.

The modern version of blackjack is believed to have been developed in France in the early 1800s. The game spread throughout Europe and North America, and eventually became a popular casino card game.

Blackjack is a casino game that was originally played in French gambling houses with cards bearing the image of an Algerian slave trader. The object of the game is to accumulate 21 points on the player's first two cards, or to come as close to 21 without exceeding it. Points are scored by taking cards that total 21 or by counting an ace (1 point) and any card worth 10 points (10 points). The word "blackjack" means a hand totaling 21 points without going over.

The popularity of blackjack grew slowly in France through the years and eventually made its way to America in the early 1800s. Gambling houses would set up tables in the back rooms of their establishments and offer blackjack games as an alternative to poker and other games of chance. Blackjack's popularity exploded in Nevada during the Gold Rush years and Las Vegas became known as "The City of Lights." Casinos began to spring up along the strip and blackjack emerged as one of the most popular casino games.

Blackjack is now enjoyed by players all over the world and continues to be one of the most popular casino games offered in casinos today.

#  Blackjack found in North Africa to have originated in Algeria

According to a new study, blackjack may have originated from the north African country of Algeria. The study, which was published in the journal "Carnet de la Recherche Ferroviaire", analyzed two different sets of cards that were found in the country. The first set of cards, which is from the 18th century, was a precursor to modern blackjack and included rules for the game that are still used today. The second set of cards, which is from the early 20th century, showed that the game had already evolved into its modern form.

The study also found that blackjack was played in other parts of North Africa, including Libya and Morocco. While it's not clear how the game spread to these countries, it's possible that it was brought over by traders or travelers. Blackjack has since become a popular casino game all over the world.
