You're probably used to playing roulette the same way every time, but have you ever tried Contra-Guess Roulette? This new variant of the classic game is lots of fun and gives you the chance to win big payouts. Read on to learn how to play and some tips for increasing your chances of winning.

# How to Play Contra-Guess Roulette

Contra-Guess Roulette is very similar to regular roulette, but with one important difference - you have to guess whether the next number will be higher or lower than the last number. So, for example, if the last number was 9, you would guess whether the next number will be 10 or 8.

There are a few other rules that you should know about before playing:

* You can only bet on a single number at a time.

* The maximum bet per spin is £250.

* The payouts are as follows: 1:1 for bets on even numbers, 2:1 for bets on odds numbers, and 5:1 for bets on black or red.

# Tips for Winning at Contra-Guess Roulette

Like all casino games, Contra-Guess Roulette is not entirely a game of chance - there are ways to improve your chances of winning. Here are some tips that will help you increase your odds:

* Always make sure you have an understanding of the rules before playing. This is especially important in Contra-Guess Roulette as the betting options are different from regular roulette.

* Start by betting low and increasing your bets gradually as you become more comfortable with the game. This will minimise your losses if you happen to lose early on in a session.

* Keep track of which numbers have been called recently and try to place your bets on those numbers accordingly. This won't guarantee that those numbers will come up again, but it does give you a better chance than betting randomly on all 36 numbers.

#  Try Out Contra-Guess Roulette for a Unique and Exciting Game-Play Experience!

If you're looking for an exciting game-play experience that is different from the traditional casino games offered, then you should definitely try out contra-guess roulette. This game debuted in 2014 and has been gaining in popularity due to its unique and thrilling game-play.

Contra-guess roulette is a variation of the standard roulette game that incorporates elements of both blackjack and poker. In this game, players are dealt two cards and must make a decision whether to bet on their hand or the dealer's hand. If the player's hand beats the dealer's hand, they win even money on their bet; if the dealer's hand beats the player's hand, the player loses their bet; and if the hands are tied, then the player neither wins nor loses their bet.

What makes contra-guess roulette so exciting is that it introduces an element of risk that is not found in other casino games. Players must decide whether to risk their bet on their own hand or put all their eggs in one basket and hope that the dealer's hand will not beat them. This makes for a very suspenseful and edge-of-your-seat experience that is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end.
