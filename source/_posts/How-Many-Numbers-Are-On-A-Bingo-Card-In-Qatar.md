In Qatar, the standard bingo card has 25 squares in 5 rows and 5 columns. As with most games, the vertical columns are labeled with letters from A to E, and the horizontal rows are lettered from 1 to 5. This means there are a total of 15 numbers in each row and 4 letters across the top and bottom (A-B-C-D-E).

There are therefore a total of 120 possible numbers on a bingo card in Qatar.

According to the official Qatar Bingo Card Regulations, each bingo card must have between 16 and 24 numbers, distributed among four rows of four numbers each. This gives you a total of 16 possible combinations.

However, in practice most bingo cards in Qatar will have between 17 and 22 numbers, with the vast majority having 18 or 19. This is because there are only a limited number of balls that can be drawn from the bingo machine, so the odds of getting a specific sequence of numbers are quite low.

If you're looking to play bingo in Qatar, make sure you bring a card with at least 17 numbers - otherwise you might be left out in the cold!

Bingo is often played in Qatar with a card having 16 squares in four rows and four columns. The center square is usually marked with a free space. Players cover the squares on their cards with random numbers selected from a container, and the first player to cover all sixteen squares on their card shouts "Bingo!" to win the game.

The game of bingo can be traced back to 1530, when an Italian lottery game called Lo Giuoco del Lotto D’Italia was introduced. It was however not until November 1924 when Edwin S. Lowe named the game “bingo” after hearing one of his assistants yell out “bingo” when she won a game.

Today, there are many variations of the game being played worldwide, but the basic premise remains the same; players mark off numbers on a grid-like board until they form a specific pattern and then announce that they have won.

Before playing any casino games in Qatar, it is important for you to understand the rules of the game. Our guide will take you through everything you need to know about playing bingo in Qatar so that you can enjoy this classic casino game and hopefully walk away with some prize money!

So how do you play? The aim of the game is to mark off numbers on your card as they are called out by the caller. The caller will read out numbers randomly from 1-90 until one player has matched them all on their card and shouts “Bingo!”. If more than one player shouts Bingo at the same time, then whichever player's card contains the last number called out is deemed the winner. Cards typically have 16 squares arranged in four rows and four columns, with the middle square designated as a free space. 

There are different ways that players can win bingo; either by completing one of the standard patterns such as a line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal), rectangle, square or full house (covering all sixteen squares on their card), or by having 4 corners marked off, 5 crosses drawn or by having 6 lines completed (including filling in the free space). 

To begin playing bingo, each player purchases a ticket or cards which will have between 24 and 36 squares printed on them (the amount depends on whether it is a 75 ball or 90 ball bingo game). Tickets usually cost anywhere from QR1 – QR5 each depending on how many balls are in play and where you purchase them from. In addition, most casinos offer players the option of purchasing multiple cards at once which can increase your chances of winning somewhat. 

Once everyone has their cards/tickets purchased, players take turns selecting balls out of a container until all 90 balls have been drawn. The balls are typically displayed on 3 LED screens above / around the bingo caller indicating which number has been drawn so that everyone can see it – this helps make sure there is no cheating! 

In general, if you want to win big then we recommend playing at one of Qatar’s high limit bingo rooms where tickets prices range from QR10-25 each and prizes for completing certain patterns can be as high as QR10,000! However for those who are just looking for some fun and don't want to risk too much money, there are plenty of lower limit rooms available with tickets prices starting from just QR1 each.
