#  The Casino Buffet at Hinckley is Headed for a Major Remodel!

Native American gaming giant, the Mohegan Sun, has announced that they will be undertaking a major remodeling project at their Hinckley casino property. The $8 million project will see the buffet area renovated and expanded.

According to a statement from the company, "The goal of the renovation is to create a world-class buffet experience that offers guests an abundance of fresh and diverse choices."

Construction is set to begin in the spring of 2019 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The buffet will remain open throughout the construction process.

This is great news for fans of the Casino Buffet at Hinckley! The current buffet is nothing special - it's your typical all-you-can-eat affair with a limited selection of food options. With this major remodel, I expect that we'll see a much improved buffet with a wider variety of food items.

I'm especially looking forward to seeing some new and innovative dishes in the buffet lineup. The Mohegan Sun team are masters when it comes to creating amazing buffets, so I have no doubt that this revamped Casino Buffet at Hinckley will be one of the best around!

This expansion is part of a larger renovation project at the casino. The project also includes the construction of a new hotel tower and an event center.
