#  Experience The Excitement Of Las Vegas' First Casino

The inaugural opening of the casino was a momentous event in Las Vegas. On May 23, 1905, Binion's Horseshoe ushered in a new era of gambling and entertainment to the city. For the first time ever, people could come and experience firsthand all that a casino had to offer.

The excitement was palpable as people from all walks of life descended on downtown Las Vegas to check out the new casino. Gamblers tested their luck at the various tables and slot machines, while others watched in anticipation as the high-rolling gamblers risked it all. The atmosphere was electric, and there was a feeling that anything could happen.

In its early days, Binion's Horseshoe was one of the most popular casinos in town. Players came from near and far to try their hand at blackjack, craps, and roulette. Celebrities and politicians alike were seen rubbing elbows with regular folk in the casino's packed gambling halls.

In its first year of operation, Binion's Horseshoe saw over $2 million in revenue from its gaming tables alone. This was an impressive feat considering that the average annual salary for an American worker at the time was just $750.

Binion's Horseshoe quickly became known for its high-stakes games and luxurious accommodations. Players could enjoy a meal in one of the several restaurants on site or retire to one of the hotel rooms for the night. There was even a barbershop for those looking to get a trim between bets.

Though times have changed since 1905, Binion's Horseshoe still remains one of the most iconic casinos in Las Vegas history. Visitors can come and experience firsthand what made this casino so legendary over 115 years ago. With its unique history and classic charm, Binion's Horseshoe is sure to excite even the most seasoned gambler.

#  Take A Step Back In Time And Visit The Las Vegas Casino's Original Location

The Las Vegas casino's original location is now a historical site. Visitors can take a step back in time and view the casino that started it all. This small casino was built in 1905 by William Stewart and his two partners. The site has been rebuilt twice but the original building still stands.

The first building was a three-story structure that had a gaming hall, bar, and five guest rooms. The casino was an instant success and soon became known as the "Little Nevada". In 1911, a fire destroyed the building and it was rebuilt later that year.

The new building had added features such as electric lighting and air conditioning. It also had a larger gaming hall that could accommodate more guests. The casino continued to grow in popularity and soon began to draw tourists from all over the world.

In 1929, the original building was torn down and replaced with a new structure. The new building was much larger and featured an Art Deco design. It also had a ballroom that could accommodate up to 1,000 guests.

The Las Vegas casino's original location is now a National Historic Landmark. Visitors can tour the site and learn about its history.
