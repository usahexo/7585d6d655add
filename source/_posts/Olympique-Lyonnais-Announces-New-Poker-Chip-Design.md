#  Olympique Lyonnais Announces New Poker Chip Design

On Wednesday, Olympique Lyonnais Football Club (O.L.), one of the most successful clubs in French football, announced a new poker chip design in collaboration with gaming company KEMAROO. The new design will be used for all official poker tournaments sponsored by O.L.

The club’s president, Jean-Michel Aulas, commented on the new chips, saying that “Our ambition is to make Lyon the capital of poker in Europe. The collaboration with Kemaroo perfectly meets this objective and provides our players with unique and innovative gaming experiences.”

KEMAROO is no stranger to designing high-quality poker chips, as they are responsible for the look of chips used in many major tournaments around the world. Olivier Paturel, CEO of KEMAROO, added that “We are proud to partner with Olympique Lyonnais and contribute to the success of its poker offering. Our teams have worked together to create a unique and innovative design that will delight players.”

The new O.L. poker chip design is inspired by the club’s iconic lion logo, which can be seen on both the chip face and edge labels. The lion is rendered in a traditional heraldry style with gold detailing on a black background. The denomination of each chip is also displayed prominently on the face, allowing for easy identification during play.

The chips will be used for all official O.L. poker tournaments from now on, starting with the Lyon Poker Open tournament taking place from October 12-14 at Casino Partouche Lyon Vert. Those looking to compete can sign up now at www.lyonpokeropen.com .
