#  World-Renowned Artist to Host Celebrity Poker Game at His Casino in Nevada 

World-renowned artist, Charles Saatchi, has announced that he will be hosting a celebrity poker game at his casino in Nevada in March. The game is expected to bring in some of the biggest names in Hollywood, and tickets are already being sold for $10,000 each.

According to Saatchi, the goal of the game is not only to have some fun, but also to raise money for charity. All of the proceeds from ticket sales will be donated to two charities chosen by Saatchi himself: The Prince’s Trust and The National Osteoporosis Society.

The Prince’s Trust helps young people who are facing a range of challenges get their lives back on track. The National Osteoporosis Society is a charity devoted to preventing bone disease and helping those who suffer from it.

When asked about why he chose these particular charities, Saatchi stated that “both of these organizations are very close to my heart. I have had personal experiences with both of them, and I know that they do great work helping people who need it. I am happy to be able to support them through this poker game.”

Tickets for the game are sure to sell out quickly, so those interested should act fast. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to see some of Hollywood’s biggest stars playing poker against each other – and all for a good cause!

#  Poker Star Phil Ivey confirmed to Play in Famous Artist's Charity Game 

An anonymous source close to the situation has exclusively confirmed to PokerNews that 10-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner Phil Ivey will be in attendance at a charity poker game organized by renowned pop artist and actor Justin Bieber later this week.

The game, which is scheduled for Thursday night at the SLS Beverly Hills Hotel in Los Angeles, is expected to raise money for hurricane victims in Texas and Florida. Along with Ivey, other big names who have committed to playing include Minnesota Vikings quarterback Teddy Bridgewater, rapper The Game, and basketball Hall of Famer Shaquille O'Neal.

Ivey has been relatively quiet since his ill-fated trip to Atlantic City last month, where he lost over $470,000 playing high-stakes baccarat at the Borgata casino. The game against Bieber is unlikely to feature any high-stakes action, but should nonetheless be entertaining given the star power in attendance.

This won't be Ivey's first foray into the celebrity poker world. In 2014 he took part in a charity game organized by actor Charlie Sheen that raised over $1 million for HIV/AIDS research.
