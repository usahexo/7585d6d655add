But what you may not know is that it could also cause you to pay more in taxes.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Gambling income is considered taxable income by the IRS, and so you will need to report any winnings on your tax return. In addition, you may also have to pay taxes on any gambling losses that you incur. This means that if you go gambling and end up losing money, you will still need to report that loss as part of your taxable income.</p>
<p>This can be particularly tricky when it comes to calculating your taxes, as it can be difficult to determine exactly how much money you’ve won or lost from gambling. The best way to handle this is to keep track of your winnings and losses for the year, and then report them accurately on your tax return. You can use Schedule A of Form 1040 to list your gambling income and losses.</p>
<p>If you do end up owing money on your taxes because of gambling income, you may be able to claim a deduction for the amount that you paid in taxes. This deduction is known as the “Other Miscellaneous Deductions” category, and it is available whether or not you itemize deductions on your tax return. To claim this deduction, simply enter the total amount of your other miscellaneous deductions on line 28 of Schedule A.</p>
<p>Gambling can be a fun way to pass the time, but it’s important to remember that it can also have consequences for your taxes. So if you’re planning on doing some gambling this year, be sure to understand how it will affect your tax return.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Could-Delay-Your-Tax-Refund"><a href="#Gambling-Could-Delay-Your-Tax-Refund" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Could Delay Your Tax Refund"></a>Gambling Could Delay Your Tax Refund</h1><p>The Internal Revenue Service says gambling could delay your tax refund.</p>
<p>IRS Acting Commissioner David Kautter testified Wednesday before the Senate Finance Committee that gambling could delay tax refunds.</p>
<p>Kautter said the agency is working to finalize its programming for the 2018 tax season but that a recent change in the law related to withholding tables could mean some taxpayers will have to wait longer for their refunds.</p>
<p>The agency had initially predicted that most taxpayers would see a refund within 21 days of filing their returns. However, the new withholding tables, which were announced in January and went into effect this month, mean many taxpayers will likely see a smaller refund or even owe money to the IRS.</p>
<p>“So there’s no question that the combination of lower withholdings and the new form are going to mean less refunds for people,” Kautter said. “It’s just a question of how much less.”</p>
<p>In order to account for the change in the law, the IRS is encouraging taxpayers to do a “paycheck checkup” on its website to ensure they are having the correct amount withheld from their paychecks.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-Winnings-Could-Be-Taxable"><a href="#Gambling-Winnings-Could-Be-Taxable" class="headerlink" title="Gambling Winnings Could Be Taxable"></a>Gambling Winnings Could Be Taxable</h1><p>The 2016 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act made a lot of changes to the tax code, but one provision that received relatively little attention was a change to the way gambling winnings are taxed. Prior to the Act, gambling winnings were considered taxable income in the year they were won. However, under the new provision, gambling winnings are now considered taxable income in the year they are received.</p>
<p>This change could have a significant impact on taxpayers who win large sums of money from gambling activities. For example, a taxpayer who won $100,000 in a casino in 2017 would have had to pay taxes on that income in 2017. But under the new provision, that taxpayer would only have to pay taxes on the $100,000 when it is actually received, which could be years after the original win.</p>
<p>This change is likely intended to simplify taxation of gambling winnings for taxpayers. It is also likely motivated by concerns that some taxpayers were avoiding paying taxes on their gambling winnings by not reporting them until years after they were won.</p>
<p>Whatever the motivation behind it, this change will likely result in increased tax revenue from gambling winnings. It is also important to note that this change applies only to gambling winnings and not to losses. So taxpayers who lose money gambling still must report those losses as deductions on their tax returns.</p>
<h1 id="How-Gambling-Affects-Federal-Tax-Returns"><a href="#How-Gambling-Affects-Federal-Tax-Returns" class="headerlink" title="How Gambling Affects Federal Tax Returns"></a>How Gambling Affects Federal Tax Returns</h1><p>In most cases, gambling income is considered taxable. This means that any winnings or losses from wagers are reported on your federal tax return. However, there are some exceptions to the rule. In this article, we will explore how gambling affects federal tax returns and what you need to know in order to file your taxes correctly.</p>
<p>Gambling income is considered taxable because it is typically seen as a form of self-employment income. This means that you are earning money from your own efforts, rather than receiving it as a gift or through investment earnings. As a result, any gambling proceeds are subject to federal income tax.</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions to this rule. For example, certain state-run lotteries are not subject to federal income tax. In addition, certain gambling losses can be deducted from your taxable income. However, in order to claim these losses, you must itemize your deductions on your federal tax return.</p>
<p>If you have gambling winnings and losses for the year, you will need to report the total amount on Form 1040, Line 21. This line is used for reporting all types of income, not just gambling proceeds. You will also need to complete Schedule D and attach it to your return. This schedule is used for reporting capital gains and losses, and it will help you determine if your gambling proceeds resulted in a net gain or loss for the year.</p>
<p>If your net gain from gambling is positive (meaning your winnings exceed your losses), then that amount will be included on Line 21 of your Form 1040 as part of your total income for the year. If your net loss from gambling is negative (meaning your losses exceed your winnings), then you can deduct that amount from other sources of income on Line 23 of Form 1040. This will help reduce your overall tax obligation for the year.</p>
<p>It is important to note that only the net amount of gambling profits or losses is subject to taxation. In other words, you cannot simply subtract your losses from your winnings and report the difference as taxable income. You must track each individual bet or wager separately in order to determine if you had a net gain or loss for the year.</p>

<h1 id="Can-I-Deduct-My-Gambling-Losses"><a href="#Can-I-Deduct-My-Gambling-Losses" class="headerlink" title="Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses?"></a>Can I Deduct My Gambling Losses?</h1><p>If you’re like many people, you enjoy gambling from time to time. But what happens when your bets don’t pan out and you end up with gambling losses? Can you deduct those losses on your taxes?</p>
<p>The answer is: maybe. Gambling losses can be deducted only if you itemize your deductions on your tax return. And even if you do itemize, your losses are only deductible to the extent of your winnings. In other words, if you had $1,000 in gambling winnings and $2,000 in gambling losses, you can only deduct $1,000 on your taxes.</p>
<p>There are a few other things to keep in mind when it comes to deducting gambling losses. For one thing, you can’t claim a loss for a bet that you never made. Additionally, if you took a deduction for gambling losses in a previous year and didn’t include the winnings from that year on your return, the IRS may reject your deduction this year.</p>
<p>So is claiming a deduction for gambling losses worth all the trouble? It depends on how much you won and lost. If you have substantial gambling losses but little or no winning bets, itemizing deductions may not be worth it since your net loss would be limited to your winning bets only. However, if you have considerable wins and only modest losses, the tax savings may be worth it.</p>
<p>If you’re considering itemizing deductions this year and have questions about whether or not your gambling losses are deductible, speak to an accountant or tax specialist for guidance.</p>
