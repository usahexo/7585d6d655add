<p>“I’m really upset about it,” said one bettor who asked to remain anonymous. “I was really looking forward to being able to bet on games legally.” </p>
<p>While some bettors are disappointed, others are viewing the news as a blessing in disguise. “This is great news for me,” said another anonymous bettor. “It means that the books won’t be able to fix the games and I’ll be able to make a lot of money.” </p>
<p>Despite the mixed reactions, one thing is clear: The decision by the Supreme Court has made waves in the gambling community.</p>
<h1 id="Boston-Casino-Commits-to-Fight-for-Sports-Betting’s-Legalization"><a href="#Boston-Casino-Commits-to-Fight-for-Sports-Betting’s-Legalization" class="headerlink" title="Boston Casino Commits to Fight for Sports Betting’s Legalization"></a>Boston Casino Commits to Fight for Sports Betting’s Legalization</h1><p>Boston casino committed to working with state and local officials to legalize sports betting in Massachusetts.</p>
<p>The Fenway Sports Group, which owns the Boston Red Sox, said it will help lead the effort to pass a bill authorizing sports betting in the state. The group is teaming up with MGM Resorts, which operates the casino in Springfield.</p>
<p>“We believe that expanded legalized sports betting could create thousands of jobs and generate economic activity in our cities and towns,” said a statement from Fenway Sports Group. “This is an important issue and we are committed to working with state and local officials to make it a reality.”</p>
<p>Massachusetts is one of several states considering legalizing sports betting after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on the practice in May. Some lawmakers have raised concerns that allowing sports betting could lead to addiction and other social problems.</p>
<p>MGM Resorts has been pushing for legalization of sports betting in Massachusetts, saying it would create jobs and bring more tourism dollars to the state. The company has also said it would give a portion of its revenues to charity.</p>
<h1 id="Proposed-Regulations-Detail-How-States-Can-Authorize-and-Regulate-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Proposed-Regulations-Detail-How-States-Can-Authorize-and-Regulate-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Proposed Regulations Detail How States Can Authorize and Regulate Sports Betting"></a>Proposed Regulations Detail How States Can Authorize and Regulate Sports Betting</h1><p>A new set of proposed regulations from the Department of Justice (DOJ) details how states can authorize and regulate sports betting within their borders. The proposed regulations were announced on Thursday by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and will be subject to a 60-day public comment period.</p>
<p>According to the proposed regulations, sports betting would be permitted only in states that have already legalized gambling. In addition, federal law would still prohibit sports betting across state lines.</p>
<p>“The Department is committed to ensuring that state legislatures, gaming regulators, and operators have the clarity they need to authorize and operate gaming within their states consistent with federal law,” said Rosenstein in a statement.</p>
<p>Under the proposed regulations, states would be able to authorize sports betting through either their legislatures or gaming commissions. State gaming commissions would then be responsible for regulating and overseeing sports betting operations. In order to protect consumers and ensure the integrity of the games, operators would be required to comply with a variety of regulations,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> including age verification procedures and limits on how much money individuals can wager.</p>
<p>The announcement of the proposed regulations comes just days after the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban on sports betting in Murphy v. National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The Supreme Court ruled that the ban was unconstitutional because it violated the Tenth Amendment’s principles of federalism.</p>
<p>In his majority opinion, Justice Samuel Alito explained that “the legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is merely to say what the law is.”</p>
<p>Justice Alito also noted that “the legalization of sports gambling requires an important policy choice, but the choice is not ours to make. Congress can regulate sports gambling directly, but if it elects not to do so, each state is free to act on its own. Our job is merely to say what the law is.”</p>
<p>With Thursday’s announcement of proposed regulations, it appears that DOJ intends to take a hands-off approach towards regulating sports betting while leaving it up to individual states to decide whether or not they want to legalize it within their borders.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Poised-to-be-the-First-State-to-Offer-Full-Scale-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Delaware-Poised-to-be-the-First-State-to-Offer-Full-Scale-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Poised to be the First State to Offer Full-Scale Sports Betting"></a>Delaware Poised to be the First State to Offer Full-Scale Sports Betting</h1><p>In a landmark development, Delaware is poised to become the first state in the US to offer full-scale sports betting. The news was confirmed by Governor John Carney on Thursday, who stated that the state would soon be taking bets on NFL and NCAA games.</p>
<p>This move comes as Delaware looks to capitalize on the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn a federal ban on sports betting. The ruling has already led several states - including New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and West Virginia - to pass legislation authorizing sports betting within their borders.</p>
<p>Delaware has been considering such a move for some time, and last month the state Gaming Commission approved three sports betting operators: Dover Downs Hotel &amp; Casino, Harrington Raceway &amp; Casino, and Delaware Park Racetrack &amp; Casinos. These casinos will now be able to offer betting on NFL, NCAA, NBA, MLB, and NHL games.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point how much revenue Delaware can expect to generate from sports betting. However, given that Americans spent an estimated $150 billion on illegal sports wagers in 2017 alone, there is certainly potential for significant profits.</p>
<p>Governor Carney is bullish about the prospects for sports betting in Delaware. “This will be another way for Delawareans to have fun and generate additional revenue for the State,” he said in a statement. “I’m pleased that our casinos are moving quickly to offer this new product.”</p>
<p>It remains to be seen exactly how big of a role sports betting will play in Delaware’s economy. However, with other states also moving swiftly to legalize it, it’s clear that this is becoming a popular pastime nationwide - and one that could provide a significant boost to state coffers.</p>
<h1 id="Professional-Sports-Leagues-Sue-New-Jersey-Over-Its-Attempt-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Professional-Sports-Leagues-Sue-New-Jersey-Over-Its-Attempt-to-Legalize-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Professional Sports Leagues Sue New Jersey Over Its Attempt to Legalize Sports Betting"></a>Professional Sports Leagues Sue New Jersey Over Its Attempt to Legalize Sports Betting</h1><p>On May 14, 2018, the National Football League (NFL), National Basketball Association (NBA), Major League Baseball (MLB), and National Hockey League (NHL) filed a lawsuit against the State of New Jersey over its attempts to legalize sports betting. The leagues argue that the state’s efforts to overturn the federal ban on sports betting are unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey. In it, the leagues allege that New Jersey’s proposed law would violate the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), a 1992 federal law that bans sports betting in all but four states. The leagues claim that New Jersey’s proposed law would supersede PASPA and allow sports betting at casinos and racetracks in the state.</p>
<p>New Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting for years. In 2011, the state passed a law that would have allowed sports betting at casinos and racetracks, but it was struck down by a federal judge. The state then tried to get around PASPA by repealing its ban on sports betting, but that was also struck down by a federal judge in 2014.</p>
<p>The leagues are asking the court to declare that New Jersey’s proposed law is unconstitutional and to stop it from being implemented. They are also seeking damages from New Jersey in an amount to be determined at trial.</p>
